Description of your font goes here. We recommend to start with a very short presentation line (the kind you would use on twitter to present your project for example), and then add as much details as necesary :-) Origin of the project, idea of usage, concept of creation… but also number of masters, axes, character sets, etc.

Don't hesitate to create images!

## About

Plaimanas07



Plaimanas07 is an open-source Thai typeface designed by Parin Rungpattaratkhun, in collaboration with Cadson Demak.  

This project began as a personal exploration into Thai letterform aesthetics, particularly focusing on how traditional calligraphy could inform a modern digital font.



While many Thai typefaces prioritize legibility or system utility, Plaimanas07 seeks to fill a different gap — the lack of Thai fonts with artistic elegance.  

The design is rooted in Thai calligraphy but redrawn with a contemporary eye, balancing emotion with precision.



This typeface is offered as a gift to the design community, with the hope that more designers will be inspired to create and elevate Thai script.



**Note:** All drawings are original. This is not a modification of an existing Thai typeface.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://cadsondemak.github.io/Plaimanas07.git.
